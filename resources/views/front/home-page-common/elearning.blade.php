                <p> As the technology is advancing, we are discovering new ways of achieving excellence. The pandemic has made us realize than ever that education has no boundaries. If we want to gain knowledge and up our skills, we can do it any way we want. Traditional classroom education has taken a hit in last two years and now e-learning has become more popular. Of course, it makes sense as it saves you time from traveling, rigid class schedules, and yes, it is affordable. E learning is an ideal option for those who find themselves unable to attend the classes because of work, family, and other reasons. It gives them access to training at any time of their convenience and learn at their own pace.
